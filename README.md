# Autonomous Car Project
 In my autonomous car project, I successfully implemented a layered architecture using the AVR microcontroller, specifically the ATmega328P, and programmed it using the C programming language. The project aimed to develop a self-driving car system capable of making intelligent decisions based on sensor inputs and executing various tasks autonomously.  The layered architecture allowed for a modular and organized design, with distinct layers responsible for different functionalities such as sensor data acquisition, perception, decision-making, and actuation. By implementing this architecture, I ensured a clear separation of concerns, making the system more robust and maintainable.  I leveraged the capabilities of the ATmega328P microcontroller to interface with an array of sensors, including cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and encoders, to gather real-time data about the car's surroundings. The acquired sensor data was processed in the perception layer, where I implemented algorithms for object detection, obstacle avoidance, and path planning.  Based on the processed sensor data, the decision-making layer utilized advanced algorithms and decision rules to determine the appropriate actions for the car, such as adjusting speed, steering, and braking. These decisions were then translated into commands and executed through the actuation layer, which controlled the motors, servos, and other actuators of the car.  Throughout the project, I demonstrated my proficiency in C programming, microcontroller interfacing, and software architecture design. The autonomous car project not only showcased my technical skills but also highlighted my ability to tackle complex problems and deliver innovative solutions in the field of autonomous systems.
